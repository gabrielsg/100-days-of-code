# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 12: Aprl 7, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started on Chapter 18 : Inheritance

**Thoughts:** distinguish between class attributes (which are defined inside a class but outside any method) and instance attribute. Alsu used new Python 3.6 f formatter. 

**Link to work:** Card.py


### Day 11: Aprl 6, 2018

**Today's Progress**: last exercise in  chapter 17 : Classes and Method

**Thoughts:** struggled with __str__ method. remember not to put () after class name when defining class. when instantiating class, then use () with parameters if needed. To uncomment code in vim in Windows, use Ctrl-Q (not Ctrl-V) to go into visual block, highlight block then Shift-I to go into Insert mode, then # and escape. Do reverse when uncommenting, but use x on the # character

**Link to work:** Kangaroo.py

### Day 10: Aprl 5, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on more exercise in chapter 17 : Classes and Method

**Thoughts:** learned about .gitignore in git. not sure how to hide dotfile and un files created by vim (persistent undo and backup) https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15660669/what-is-a-un-file-or-or-why-does-vim-in-the-terminal-make-the-un-file

**Link to work:** Point2.py, Time2.py


### Day 9: Aprl 3, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on exercise in chatper 17 : Classes and Method

**Thoughts:** __init__ makes it easier to instantiate objects and __str__ which is useful for debugging. Other special methods include __add__, __lt__, ... http://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#specialnames

**Link to work:** Point2.py, Time2.py

### Day 8: Aprl 2, 2018

**Today's Progress**: No coding. Just read chapter 17 of Think Python 2nd Ed

**Thoughts:** introduce methods to programmer defined types, ie class

**Link to work:** NA


### Day 7: Aprl 1, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished exercises on datetime objects

**Thoughts:** not quite sure about timedelta object and attributes

**Link to work:** Time1.py


### Day 6: March 31, 2018

**Today's Progress**: More exercise on Time class

**Thoughts:** use replace r in vim to edit characters more efficiently

**Link to work:** Time1.py

### Day 5: March 30, 2018

**Today's Progress**: worked on time. learned about Functional Program which doesn't change the objects it takes as its parameter

**Thoughts:** don't know how to efficently comment out code in vim. Control v paste instead of go into visual block

**Link to work:** Time1.py

### Day 4: March 29, 2018

**Today's Progress**: skipped 28 Mar because of work. Resumed last fuction : draw rectangle

**Thoughts:** for loop : instead of iterable object (for x in range(5)), use explicit expression, ie for x in a, b, c, d.

**Link to work:** draw.py

### Day 3: March 27, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Classes and Objects exercises 15.2 from Think Complexity. 

**Thoughts:** Learn that when import module polygon, refer to function by using dot notation : eg polygon.circle. Also vim plug-ins show useful hints if imported modules/fuction are available

**Link to work:** draw.py

### Day 2: March 26, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Classes and Objects exercises 15.1 from Think Complexity. 

**Thoughts:** Learn how reuse classes and functions by importing Point.py as module and how to navigate in VIM and also add-on NERDTree)

**Link to work:** Cicle.py (worked on function Rectangle in Circle; pending one more function)

### Day 1: March 25, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Classes and Objects exercises 15.1 from Think Complexity. 

**Thoughts:** Learn how reuse classes and functions by importing Point.py as module and how to navigate in VIM and also add-on NERDTree)

**Link to work:** Cicle.py (still WIP; haven't worked on 2 more functions)


### Day 0: March 24, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Classes and Objects exercises, Chatper 15 from Think Complexity. 

**Thoughts:** Spent a lot of time setting up VIM and github on Windows 10. Learnt basics of Github from https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1 and StackFlow https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37937984/git-refusing-to-merge-unrelated-histories-on-rebase when couldn't get git pull and push to work (first pull forked repository with --allow-unrelated-histories flag then git push)

**Link to work:** Point.py
