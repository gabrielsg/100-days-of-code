# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: March 24, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Classes and Objects exercises, Chatper 15 from Think Complexity. 

**Thoughts:** Spent a lot of time setting up VIM and github on Windows 10. Learnt basics of Github from https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1 and StackFlow https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37937984/git-refusing-to-merge-unrelated-histories-on-rebase when couldn't get git pull and push to work (first pull forked repository with --allow-unrelated-histories flag then git push)

**Link to work:** Point.py

### Day 1: March 25, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Classes and Objects exercises 15.1 from Think Complexity. 

**Thoughts:** Learn how reuse classes and functions by importing Point.py as module and how to navigate in VIM and also add-on NERDTree)

**Link to work:** Cicle.py (still WIP; haven't worked on 2 more functions)

### Day 2: March 26, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Classes and Objects exercises 15.1 from Think Complexity. 

**Thoughts:** Learn how reuse classes and functions by importing Point.py as module and how to navigate in VIM and also add-on NERDTree)

**Link to work:** Cicle.py (worked on function Rectangle in Circle; pending one more function)

### Day 3: March 27, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Classes and Objects exercises 15.2 from Think Complexity. 

**Thoughts:** Learn that when import module polygon, refer to function by using dot notation : eg polygon.circle. Also vim plug-ins show useful hints if imported modules/fuction are available

**Link to work:** draw.py

### Day 4: March 29, 2018

**Today's Progress**: skipped 28 Mar because of work. Resumed last fuction : draw rectangle

**Thoughts:** for loop : instead of iterable object (for x in range(5)), use explicit expression, ie for x in a, b, c, d.

**Link to work:** draw.py
