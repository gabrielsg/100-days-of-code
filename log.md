**Thoughts:** Learn that when import module polygon, refer to function by using dot notation : eg polygon.circle. Also vim plug-ins show useful hints if imported modules/fuction are available

**Link to work:** draw.py

### Day 2: March 26, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Classes and Objects exercises 15.1 from Think Complexity. 

**Thoughts:** Learn how reuse classes and functions by importing Point.py as module and how to navigate in VIM and also add-on NERDTree)

**Link to work:** Cicle.py (worked on function Rectangle in Circle; pending one more function)

### Day 1: March 25, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Classes and Objects exercises 15.1 from Think Complexity.
